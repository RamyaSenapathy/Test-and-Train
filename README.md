# Test-and-Train
- column_names : Read the file **"features.txt"** it has all the 561 column names , column names are same for both train and test so single file can be used for both.
- ## Test data
- test_x : Read the file **"X_test.txt",** this file has all the measurements (2947*561)
- test_y : Read the file **"y_test.txt",** this file has all the Activity numbers(1-6) (2947*1)
- sub_test : Read the file **"subject_test.txt",** this file has all the subjects number (2947*1)
- Changed the column name for : test_y and sub_test to "Activity" & "Subject" 
- Added extra column to the data frame : test_x from the column_names$V2
- test_data : *joined* 3dfs(test_y,sub_test,test_x) with cbind 
- ## Train data
- train_x : Read the file **"X_train.txt"** (7352*561) this file has all the measurements
- train_y : Read the file **"y_train.txt"** (7352*1) this file has all the Activity numbers(1-6)
- sub_train :  Read the file **"subject_train.txt"** this file has all the subjects number (7352*1)
- Changed the column name for : train_y and sub_train to "Activity" & "Subject" 
- Added extra column to the data frame : train_x from the column_names$V2
- train_data <- *joined* 3dfs(train_y,sub_train,train_x) with cbind 
- ## Data : merge Test and Train
- data : *merged* Test and Train dataframe : test_data + train_data with rbind
- activity_name : read Read the file **"activity_labels.txt"**,this file has all the activity names with code (1-6 & label)
- activity_name : changed the column name to "id","Activity"
- ## data_final : Data + activity_name
- data_final : activity_name + data with the help of dplyr package: subsetted the dataframe 
- data_mean_std : data with mean and standard deviation values with Activty and Subject columns
- ## Final Data Set
- grouped_data : grouped with Activty(1-6) and Subject (1-30) and then calculated mean for each measurements - after grouping.20. now the row count is : 6*30 = 180 and column count = 88(including : Activty and Subject)
